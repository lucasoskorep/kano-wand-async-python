This package allows users to access the BLE capabilities of their Kano coding wand using an asynchronous python API.  
    
    API design taken from - https://github.com/GammaGames/kano_wand and then adapted and updated for asynchronous python.
    
    New version is asynchronous and in addition is not cross playform due to its usage of pybluez instead of BLEAK for BLE access.
